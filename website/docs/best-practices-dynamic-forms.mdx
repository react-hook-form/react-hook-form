# Best Practices for Dynamic Forms

Dynamic forms are forms where fields can appear, disappear, or change dynamically based on user input or other conditions. React Hook Form provides powerful tools to handle dynamic forms efficiently.

## 1. Use `useFieldArray` for Field Arrays

When you have a dynamic list of fields (e.g., adding multiple users), use `useFieldArray` instead of manually managing state.

```tsx
import { useForm, useFieldArray } from "react-hook-form";

function App() {
  const { control, register, handleSubmit } = useForm();
  const { fields, append, remove } = useFieldArray({ control, name: "users" });

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit(data => console.log(data))}>
      {fields.map((field, index) => (
        <div key={field.id}>
          <input {...register(`users.${index}.name` as const)} />
          <button type="button" onClick={() => remove(index)}>Delete</button>
        </div>
      ))}
      <button type="button" onClick={() => append({ name: "" })}>Add User</button>
      <input type="submit" />
    </form>
  );
}

2. Use shouldUnregister for Conditional Fields

For fields that appear/disappear based on conditions, set shouldUnregister: true in useForm to remove them from form values when unmounted.

const { register, handleSubmit } = useForm({ shouldUnregister: true });

3. Leverage watch for Dynamic UI Updates

Use watch to dynamically render fields based on other field values.

const watchAge = watch("age");
return watchAge > 18 ? <input {...register("driverLicense")} /> : null;

4. Default Values & Resets

Always provide defaultValues and use reset carefully to handle dynamic updates.

reset({ users: [{ name: "John" }] });

5. Optimize Performance

Use shouldFocusError: true to focus first error automatically.

Use mode: "onChange" to reduce unnecessary renders.

Avoid anonymous functions in JSX when registering fields dynamically.


6. Tips

Keep your dynamic forms simple and predictable.

Use key={field.id} when rendering dynamic lists.

Combine useFormContext if using nested forms for better maintainability.
