# MUI DatePicker Example (React Hook Form)

This example demonstrates how to correctly integrate MUI DatePicker with React Hook Form, ensuring proper focus behavior when validation errors occur.

It provides:

- A minimal reproducible example for maintainers
- Correct integration using `Controller`
- Usage of `LocalizationProvider` and `AdapterDateFns`
- Working validation with `shouldFocusError: true`

This example was created to support the fix for issue #13172.
